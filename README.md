    3. The contact file was validated by [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) no errors were found but a warning about the Unicode Private Use Area I used when placing the fontawesome icon folowed by (;). After searching in [Stack Overflow: Answer by Mike Smith](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23978976/fontawesome-usage-displeases-w3c-validator/31703251#31703251) and reading the articles https://www.w3.org/TR/charmod/#C073 and https://hsivonen.fi/charmod-checking/ , I undrestood the issues that these are documented/standardized linting rules but also, if I've checked the file in different browsers and itâ€™s working fine, I can safely ignore this warning.

## Solved bugs

- ### Using Chrome Devtool
    - The Hero image ... 

    - For mobile device the texts in both the experience box and the skills box in the Experience page used to overlap. To fix the problem I changed the div height style from height to min-height.
    ![exp-box: before](/docs/exp-box.png)

    - The button under the hero image was floating to the left so I had to delete the __justify_content_center__ and then give it the approbrite margin top and bottom.
    ![button: before](/docs/button.png)

- ### Using Lighthouse
    When ckecking through lighthouse for desktop and mobile devices I got these results
![Desktop: before](/docs/1.png)

    ![Mobile: before](/docs/3.png)

    The accessibilty score was 89 and 78 so, to solve the issue for users who rely on screen readers I added _aria-label="button"_ to all button elements, _aria-label="Link to"_ to all link elements and for the text elements to have sufficient color contrast against the background I darkend the background for the buttons from  #159765 to #0f5b3e5f.

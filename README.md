# UX Design

## Wireframes

 The initial design of the website was set by using figma to look like this
 https://www.figma.com/proto/YeFJCf1jd1hRs31LjMqynH/Portfolio-sample1?node-id=31%3A221&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=31%3A221 as one page with differnt sections.

 But while designing, I made the Hero image with the name/title with a link button as Home page and the rest of the content in another -About me page-. I deleted the contact footer and I made it as an indpended page with a form to be completed and a send button when clicked it will take you into a Thank you page. The header is fixed at the top that means it stcks at the top even if the user scrolls down and it contains links for pages with a logo at the top left.  
 The footer is simple it has the four icons to the social networks.

### test cases (screenshots)

- The footer was annoying. It kepting sticking on top of the header. I gave it the margin-top:100% so that it can go down it worked but it add a more size to the whole page. The mistake was that I was using percintage rather than a px or rem mersuermints. It worked well when the  margin-bottom: 10px; and margin-top: 20px;

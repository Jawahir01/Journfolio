# UX Design

## Wireframes

 The initial design of the website was set by using figma to look like this
 https://www.figma.com/proto/YeFJCf1jd1hRs31LjMqynH/Portfolio-sample1?node-id=31%3A221&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=31%3A221 as one page with differnt sections.

 But while designing, I made the Hero image with the name/title with a link button as Home page and the rest of the content in another -About me page-. I deleted the contact footer and I made it as an indpended page with a form to be completed and a send button when clicked it will take you into a Thank you page. The header is fixed at the top that means it stcks at the top even if the user scrolls down and it contains links for pages with a logo at the top left.  
 The footer is simple it has the four icons to the social networks.

# testing

### code validation
- **HTML**
    1. The index file was validated by [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and no errors or warning found. 
    !()[]

    2. The experince file was validated by [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and no errors or warning found.
    !()[]

    3. The contact file was validated by [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) no errors were found but a warning about the Unicode Private Use Area I used when placing the fontawesome icon folowed by (;). After searching in [Stack Overflow: Answer by Mike Smith](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23978976/fontawesome-usage-displeases-w3c-validator/31703251#31703251) and reading the articles https://www.w3.org/TR/charmod/#C073 and https://hsivonen.fi/charmod-checking/ , I undrestood the issues that these are documented/standardized linting rules but also, if I've checked the file in different browsers and itâ€™s working fine, I can safely ignore this warning.

### Test Cases

- The footer was annoying. It kepting sticking on top of the header. I gave it the margin-top:100% so that it can go down it worked but it add a more size to the whole page. The mistake was that I was using percintage rather than a px or rem mersuermints. It worked well when the  margin-bottom: 10px; and margin-top: 20px;

- 

- The hero image was not responsive 

I had to change the size from cover to contain 

- The button under the hero image was not responsive though I gave it the justify-content-center class and it was floating to the left so I had to change its display to flex and give it the approbrite margin top and bottom.

- the box inside

**Lighthouse**

when ckecking through lighthouse for mobile devices, I got these results
![]()
The accessibilty score was 78 so, to solve the issue for users who rely on screen readers I added _aria-label="button"_ to all button elements 

### Known bugs

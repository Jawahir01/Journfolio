### test cases (screenshots)

- The footer was annoying. It kepting sticking on top of the header. I gave it the margin-top:100% so that it can go down it worked but it add a more size to the whole page. The mistake was that I was using percintage rather than a px or rem mersuermints. It worked well when the  margin-bottom: 10px; and margin-top: 20px;
